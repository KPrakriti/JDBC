JDBC stands for Java Database Connectivity. Connecting Java application with Data base is JDBC.

To connect Java application with Database - there are 7 steps
Import the package
Load and register the driver
Establish the connection
Create the statement
Execute the query
Process result
Close

Driver for mysql is com.mysql.jdbc.driver
To register a Driver-> class.forName(com.mysql.jdbc.Driver)

Writing the above 7 steps in Code

Import java.sql.*;
P S V M (){
Class.forName(“com.mysql.jdbc.Driver”);

Connection con = DriverManager.getConnection(“ URL ”, “ UserName “, “ Password ” );
Statement st = con.CreateStatement();
ResultSet rs = st.executeQuery(“Select * from table”);

rs.next();
rs.getInt(1) + “ “ + rs.getString(2);

st.Clsoe();
Con.Close();
}

DDL - Data Definition Language - Creating structure of a table falls into DDL
DML - Data manipulation Language - Data Manipulation such as Insert, Update
DQL - Data Query Language - used for fetching data from the database. For DQL we use execute query.


If you are using Eclipse 
then you’ll have to register the jdbc connector in your java project. For this right click on your project -> build path - > configure build path
